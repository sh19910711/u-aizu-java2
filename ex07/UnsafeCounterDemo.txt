The result will be incorrect because a value incremented by a thread could be ignored by another thread,
and the count could be used a previous count value, possibly.

Let think "cnt ++" if cnt = 123, and Thread 1 and 2 starts simultaneously.
And then the following situation might be happened:

Thread 1: cnt = (123 + 1)
=> cnt = 124

Thread 2: cnt = (123 + 1) or (124 + 1)
=> cnt = 124 or 125
